# Project Identify Sailing Ships from images

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Classical sailing ships have many different types based on the number of masts, rigging and sail plans.
The AI would identify from side view image the type of the sailing ship.

## Background

The identifier could go through plenty images e.g. in world wide web and categorize sea vessels in them. The imagery can more easily be used in follow-up projects.   

* Typical sailing ships have 1 - 5 masts that partially define the type
* Different sail plan and rigging with same number of masts lead to different types 
* Sailing ships from different era have different sail plans
* Sailing ships from different regions have different sail plans
* Hull of the ship is different depending on the era and the region

## How is it used?

The application is given an image and it tries to identify the type of vessels in the image.
The application may be available on the net.
Users could be sailing enthusiasts, media personnel, historians, etc.

## Data sources and AI methods
Images may come from openly available image galleries.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for finding out the patterns of sail plans and masts.

## Challenges

The first challenges may be in defining the filter-images for different sailing ship types.

## What next?

Anyone may take this project to build up.
Typical images for sail plans are shown e.g. on Wikipedia: Sailing ships.
